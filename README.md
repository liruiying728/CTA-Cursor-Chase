# CTA Cursor Chase

This is a lightweight demo where a CTA button follows the user’s cursor to draw attention and improve conversion.
The button hides temporarily when the cursor is idle or copying text, and reappears once the mouse starts moving again.

No deployment is needed — just download and open index.html in your browser.
